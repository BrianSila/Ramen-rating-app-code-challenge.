# Ramen-Rating-App. 

*A simple and intuitive Ramen rating app .*

# Instructions

### Deliverables

**1. Display Ramen Images:**

* Create a displayRamens() function.
* Load images from the ramens array using standard JavaScript array methods (e.g., forEach) and append them as <img> elements inside the #ramen-menu div.
  
**2. Ramen Detail Display:**

* Clicking a ramen image triggers a handleClick function that displays the ramen details (name, restaurant, and optionally rating and comment) in the #ramen-detail div.

**3. Handle New Ramen Form Submission:**

* Create an addSubmitListener function.
Initialize App: When a user fills out the form and submits it, add the new ramen image to the #ramen-menu div. Updating the DOM is sufficient (no data persistence required).

**4. Initialize App:**

* Write a main function that initializes your application by invoking:
  * displayRamens()
  * addSubmitListener()

### Advanced Requirements (Optional)

* Display the details for the first ramen automatically on page load without user interaction.
* Allow users to edit the rating and comments for selected ramen and display updated info dynamically.
* Implement deletion functionality to remove a ramen from the display.
